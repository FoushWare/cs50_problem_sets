0.  Png => 16.7 Million colors, JPEG => 16.7 Million colors, GIF => 256 Colors, BMP => 16.7 Million colors.
1.  GIF is the only format that supports animation.
2.  As you compress and decompress a certian format of files repeatedly, files will progrssively lose quality; this is called 
    losssy compression. In loseless compression, quality remains the same regards of the number of times file has been
    compressed or decompressed.   
3.  JPEGs are lossy-compressed
4.  When a file is deleted in FAT system, metadata that is pointed to that file is rewritten while disk blocks containing the file's content are still there.
5.  I would use a data destruction software that would over-write the disk so many times that it would be nearly impossible to recover the data.
6.  <stdint.h> is a header file located in the C standard Library which "allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs,"
    that narrow down specific typedefs in exact-integer types.
7.  These are predefined signed TYPES for specific number usage
8.  BYTE => 8-bit, DWORD => 32-bit, LONG => 32-bit, WORD => 16-bit
9.  Signature letters BM with hex value (0x42 0x4D)
10. befSize is the bitmap file size in bytes and biSize is the header size which must be be at least 40 bytes
11. A negative value for biHeight occurs when pixel data is ordered from the top-down
12. The biBitCount field specifies the BMP's color depth.
13. Fopen may return NULL value when file is too large and there is not enough space or user does not authorized to create file
14. The third argument to fread takes in the size of the bitmapfile header and each bitmap image comes with only one header.
15. It gets a value of 1
16. The fseek() function is used to change the file postion of the stream
17. Used as an argument for fseek(); shows the position of the postion pointer
18. It is none other than ROB BOWDEN and his CAT
